## Managing Staff Members

Staff members added here will have access to the system and also able to enter the premisses. They are assigned to a staff group which will allow them to access premises for 365 days a year. This need to be refreshed every year to ensure continued access.

### Creating a Staff Member

To add a new staff member, navigate to the "Staff Members" section and click on the "New staff member" button. Fill in the required details. Provide a temporary password and share it with the staff member to log in for the first time. Please ensure that the staff member changes their password upon first login for security purposes.

### Actions

Admin users can perform various actions on staff members such as enabling or disabling their access, extending their access period, editing their details, or deleting their profile.
