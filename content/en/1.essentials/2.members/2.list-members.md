## Member List
The member list displays all registered members along with their details. You can search using name, member id or phone number to find specific members quickly. 

### Filters

You can filter members based on various criteria such as membership status, membership type, assigned staff member and if the member is available on all devices. This helps in narrowing down the list to specific groups of members.

### Table columns

Additional columns can be added to the member list table for more detailed information. You can choose to display columns such as image, mobile number and status.
