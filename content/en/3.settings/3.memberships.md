## Limited Access 
::warning
Additional paid module required.
::
If you want to restrict access to locations by days, you can use this to achieve that. 

![Limited Access Settings](settings/limited-access.png)

When attaching devices to a membership type, you can set the number of days a member is allowed to enter each location. 

> For example, if you set 7 days for Door 2, a member with this membership type can enter Door 2 for 7 days in their membership period. When the 7 days are used up, they will be denied access to Door 2 even if their membership is still valid.

### Extending access

To extend access days for a specific location, you can do so from the member's profile page. That price can be different from the original membership price and it can be set on the membership type settings page.
